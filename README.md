# kosmoplex-simulation
This is a simulation of how alpha or the FSC is the communication channel for the bidirectional creation and the observation of all particle classes.  With it's 137 channels, the FSC acts as the comms link between our 8D upstairs and 4D downstairs reality.  We compare our simulated dato to LHC actual results.
