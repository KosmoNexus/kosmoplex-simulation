# Kosmoplex Simulation: Alpha as Particle Formation Channel

This repository contains a Python simulation of particle formation in the Kosmoplex Theoretical Framework, where the fine-structure constant (α ≈ 1/137.036) governs the information channel for 8D-to-4D projections. It models an entangled proton-W boson pair, incorporating strong interactions, and compares timescales to LHC data.
